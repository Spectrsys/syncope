                <span style="font-weight: bold">Apache Syncope</span>
                is an Open Source system for managing digital identities in enterprise environments, 
                implemented in JEE technology and released under Apache 2.0 license.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to run Apache Syncope, a J2EE container (Apache Tomcat, for example) and a DBMS are only needed.
                <br/>
                Most DBMSes available either on the market or in the Open Source space are fully supported.

            <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Apache Syncope is an effort undergoing
                <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">incubation</a>
                at
                The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly
                accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making
                process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
                While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code,
                it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
            </p>
